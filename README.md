ECE466: Compilers

Building a compiler for the C programming language.


## Assignment 3 Todo:
* Incorporate symbol table into parser.
* Build functionality to print out the symbol table entires as they appear in similar format to AST nodes being printed.
* Build grammar for C declarations and finish up SIZEOF and casting expressions.

#### Status and next on the agenda:
* Got most of the required functionality to work (scalars, arrays, functions, pointers, structs, unions, and scopes). Next steps:
* Implement the large type checking function to make sure craziness isn't happening (not sure if it is needed though).
* Implement function declarations
* Implement abstract types & use them in sizeof expressions and cast expressions.


##### Stretch goals:
* Implement function prototypes.
* Implement enums.

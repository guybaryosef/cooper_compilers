ECE466: Compilers

Building a compiler for the C programming language.


## Todo:
* Incorporate symbol table into parser.
* Build functionality to print out the symbol table entires as they appear in similar format to AST nodes being printed.
* Build grammar for C declarations and finish up SIZEOF and casting expressions.

Next on the agenda:
* Finish implementing combineSpecifierDeclarator.
* Begin debugging, see if you need to add any more skeleton pieces to get the basic grammar working.

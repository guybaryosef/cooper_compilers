ECE466: Compilers

Building a compiler for the C programming language.


## Assignment 3 Todo:
* Incorporate symbol table into parser.
* Build functionality to print out the symbol table entires as they appear in similar format to AST nodes being printed.
* Build grammar for C declarations and finish up SIZEOF and casting expressions.

#### Next on the agenda:
* Fix shift-reduce conflicts on scalar types.
* Decide how to get the ident in the decl-init-list - maybe look at how you implemented structs?
* Build grammar for declarators in general (start with simply-declarator, move on to pointers and arrays and functions).
* Begin testing.
